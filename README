To build the ovpn-dco kernel module, just type:

$ make

in the root folder.
The Makefile will autodetect your running kernel and will try to use its
headers to get the code compiled.

If you want to build the ovpn-dco against a kernel different from the one
running on the host, run:

$ make KERNEL_SRC=/path/to/the/kernel/tree`

The control is passed to the kernel Makefile, therefore any kernel Makefile
argument can be specified on the command line and it will be passed
automatically.

Executing the command:

$ make install

will install the ovpn-dco.ko kernel module in the updates/ subfolder of
the kernel modules directory on your system.
It normally means `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/updates/`.

A basic pre-shared-key client is also provided in the tests/ folder.
It can be compiled by typing:

$ make tests
